    #### [**Technological Unemployment in Victorian Britain: A Tasks-Based Approach**](https://github.com/HillaryVipond/Dissertation) *(JMP)*  

    **Hillary Vipond**  

    There is no quantitative record of jobs lost to, and generated by, creative destruction as industries mechanized in Great Britain over the 19th century. Such a record would enable a long-run view of the impact of occupational decline, adding a dimension to debates on the future of work.  

    I create a new, sub-industry level of occupation for England between 1851–1911, using text recorded in individual-level English census observations, as digitized by the Integrated Census Microdata project (ICeM). I focus on the impact of mechanization on the bootmaking industry and assign 1.3 million English bootmakers to the sub-industry "tasks" they performed.  

    I show that technological unemployment, obscured at an industry-level analysis, is revealed at the task level. In bootmaking, the occupational structure was transformed as the industry mechanized. Approximately **152,000 jobs disappeared** as skills became obsolete, while **144,000 new jobs** demanding different skills emerged. These new jobs went almost entirely to young bootmakers, while incumbents did not transition into the new employment opportunities.  

    This was not a case of widespread labor displacement—rather, incumbents were "grandfathered out." The technological shock primarily reshaped the **matrix of employment opportunities available to young people**.
