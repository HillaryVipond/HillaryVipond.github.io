    <p><strong>Hillary Vipond</strong></p>

    <p>There is no quantitative record of jobs lost to, and generated by, creative destruction as industries mechanized in Great Britain over the 19th century. Such a record would enable a long-run view of the impact of occupational decline, adding a dimension to debates on the future of work.</p>

    <p>I create a new, sub-industry level of occupation for England between 1851â€“1911, using text recorded in individual-level English census observations, as digitized by the Integrated Census Microdata project (ICeM). I focus on the impact of mechanization on the bootmaking industry and assign 1.3 million English bootmakers to the sub-industry "tasks" they performed.</p>

    <p>I show that technological unemployment, obscured at an industry-level analysis, is revealed at the task level. In bootmaking, the occupational structure was transformed as the industry mechanized. Approximately <strong>152,000 jobs disappeared</strong> as skills became obsolete, while <strong>144,000 new jobs</strong> demanding different skills emerged. These new jobs went almost entirely to young bootmakers, while incumbents did not transition into the new employment opportunities.</p>

    <p>This was not a case of widespread labor displacementâ€”rather, incumbents were "grandfathered out." The technological shock primarily reshaped the <strong>matrix of employment opportunities available to young people</strong>.</p>
