    <p><strong>Hillary Vipond (KMP</strong></p>

    <p>There is no quantitative record of jobs lost to, and generated by, creative destruction as industries mechanized in Great Britain over the 19th century. Such a record would enable a long-run view of the impact of occupational decline, adding a dimension to debates on the future of work.</p>

    <p>I create a new, sub-industry level of occupation for England between 1851â€“1911, using text recorded in individual-level English census observations, as digitized by the Integrated Census Microdata project (ICeM). I focus on the impact of mechanization on the bootmaking industry and assign 1.3 million English bootmakers to the sub-industry "tasks" they performed.</p>

    <p>I show that technological unemployment, obscured at an industry-level analysis, is revealed at the task level. In bootmaking, the occupational structure was transformed as the industry mechanized. Approximately <strong>152,000 jobs disappeared</strong> as skills became obsolete, while <strong>144,000 new jobs</strong> demanding different skills emerged. These new jobs went almost entirely to young bootmakers, while incumbents did not transition into the new employment opportunities.</p>

    <p>This was not a case of widespread labor displacementâ€”rather, incumbents were "grandfathered out." The technological shock primarily reshaped the <strong>matrix of employment opportunities available to young people</strong>.</p>

Evidence from Jewish Immigration and the Tailoring Industry in England</strong></a></h4>
    <p><strong>Yannis Kastis (JMP), Hillary Vipond</strong></p>
    <p>This paper provides causal evidence on the role of organizational practices in driving technology adoption. We examine a shift in practices in the English tailoring
industry, prompted by the arrival of Jewish immigrant tailors who fled pogroms in the Russian Empire between 1881 and 1905. By the time Jewish tailors arrived in
England, garment production was predominantly bespoke and native tailors were using sewing machines - introduced in the 1860s - to increase individual productivity. In Russia, where sewing machines were unavailable, Jewish tailors specialized in ready-to-wear production, which involved a greater division of labor into specialized tasks than bespoke work. Upon arriving in England, they combined the available sewing machines with their organizational practice to scale up ready-to-wear production. Using original data on production tasks and firm-level data, we study
how this shift influenced the adoption of the sewing machine and the transition to mass production of garments in England. Our findings show that organizational practices are instrumental in integrating new technologies into production.
