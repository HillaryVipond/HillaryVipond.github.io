I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Transforming Economies team at the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna, where we apply data science methodologies to study the impacts of AI on economic growth and the labour market. 

Having recently graduated from the London School of Economics with a PhD in Economic History, I remain affiliated with the Historical Economic Demography Group and the Inequaties Institute at LSE. I am a senior Atlantic Fellow and in 2024 was a visiting student at Harvard.

My research is on how technological change reshapes labour markets, applying data-driven methods from microeconomics, machine learning, and natural language processing. My PhD dissertation, *Technological Unemployment in Victorian Britain: A Tasks Based Approach*, examines technological innovation and labour market dynamics in 19th-century Britain, a period of rapid technological change. The research won the prize for best new doctoral research at the Economic History Society conference (UK) and the Sokoloff Fellowship from the Economic History Association (USA).
