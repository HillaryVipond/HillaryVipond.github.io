I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Transforming Economies team at the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna, where we apply data science methodologies to study the impacts of AI on economic growth and the labour market. I have recently graduated from the London School of Economics with a PhD in Economic History. I am an Alumni Researcher with LSE's Historical Economic Demography Group, a Visiting Fellow at the LSE Inequaties Institute, and a senior Atlantic Fellow. In 2024 I was a visiting student at Harvard, based at the Growth Lab in the Kennedy School. 

My research is on how technological change reshapes labour markets, applying data-driven methods from microeconomics, machine learning, and natural language processing. My PhD dissertation, *Technological Unemployment in Victorian Britain: A Tasks Based Approach*, examines technological innovation and labour market dynamics in 19th-century Britain, a period of rapid technological change. The research won the prize for best new doctoral research at the Economic History Society conference (UK) and the Sokoloff Fellowship from the Economic History Association (USA). My current projects are focused on: understanding the impact of the time dimension of adoption of new technologies in allocating the impact of labour saving technological shocks, developing a more granular understanding of changes in the occupational structure in 19th century Britain, the social mobility implications of technological change, and methodological advances in record linking historical census data.
